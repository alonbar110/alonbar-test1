This directory contains code and data to reproduce the results of the paper:
"Seasonal hormone oscillations in humans governed by gland-size-control feedback loops"

# Tested in Python version 3.7 (Windows, Mac OS)
# required python packages:

numpy
scipy
matplotlib
pandas
sympy
glob
calendar
sklearn.linear_model
json
pylab

# There is no need to install anything beyond python, Jupyter notebook, and the packages above
# Tested in "Jupyter Notebook", To run code/demo, open code file in Jupyter notebook and run
# Expected output is figures similar to the figures in the paper
# Running all files takes few minutes, with one exception: in "seasonality.ipynb", when computing the dependency of cortisol amplitude on latitude (3rd box), running time may get up to 15-20 minutes
